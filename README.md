# Newscred
## Inspiration
"Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump." "WikiLeaks CONFIRMS Hillary Sold Weapons to ISIS." These stories and a whole lot more blew up on social media in the run-up to Election Day, spreading misinformation and drowning out legitimate news sources.

## What it does
A news credibility platform which will consist of a chrome extension and web application. User submitted ratings of news articles are linked to rated article. Ratings are shared between all users of the extension where they can view things such as user tags, author rating, and article rating. The web application works as a search engine for our api where users can view aggregated information about an author or article. The impact of this will determine the credibility of an article, the author, and website as a whole.
## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into
Setting up dockers, spreading thin on various components of the platform.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning new technologies, collaborating, combining ideas.

## What we learned
Learned to not underestimate the amount of development and operations that are required to complete various tasks.

## What's next for NewsCred
Scaling to other news outlet i.e. smaller news article.
Adding a moderator, machine learning algorithm to filter out spams.

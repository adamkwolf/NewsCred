## Inspiration  
Major topics in the news today threaten the legitimacy of the media. With the White House and the President claiming certain media outlets are "Fake News," and an ever increasing spread of misleading or misinformation. I wanted to create this project to solve this problem. If we had a way to croud-source article ratings then we can determine the legitimacy of the author and article as a whole.
  
## What it does  
A news credibility platform which will consist of a chrome extension and web application. User submitted ratings of news articles are linked to rated article. Ratings are shared between all users of the extension where they can view things such as user tags, author rating, and article rating. The web application works as a search engine for our api where users can view aggregated information about an author or article. The impact of this will determine the credibility of an article, the author, and website as a whole.
